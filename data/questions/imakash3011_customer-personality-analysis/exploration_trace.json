Previously we used df_split = df.iloc[:,0]... but df still exists. However earlier we executed df.info() which succeeded. Now df.columns fails. Possibly df is a Series after previous operations? Let's check variables:```python\nvars()\n``````python\nlist(globals().keys())\n```\u2717 Cell 1 failed\n\nMaybe the kernel restricts introspection? Let's try printing df.head again to see column names.```python\ndf.head()\n```\u2717 Cell 1 failed\n\nIt seems df is no longer defined? Perhaps previous error caused df variable to be overwritten?

Perhaps the previous error killed the session? We need to reload the data. The dataset is presumably loaded into variable df initially. Let's re-read the CSV? The dataset description says \"Analysis of company's ideal customers\". Maybe the original CSV file path? Not given. However we have df variable originally. We can re-import using pd.read_csv? But cannot import file path. Might be that the data is stored in a variable called df already loaded at start. Since it's gone, we need to load again. Perhaps the data is in a file named 'data.csv'? Not sure. Could use pd.read_csv with a placeholder? We may need to ask system to show available files. But cannot ask. However we can try to list files.```python\nimport os, json, sys, pathlib, pandas as pd\nlist(os.listdir('.'))\n``````python\n# Attempt to load the dataset from a common filename\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf.head()\n```\u2717 Cell 1 failed\n\nFile not found. Let's list files using os.listdir but without import? Maybe os is already available. Try using %ls magic? Not allowed. Might be able to use !ls command.```python\nimport subprocess, shlex, sys, os, pandas as pd\nsubprocess.run(['ls', '-1'], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.splitlines()\n``````python\ntype(df_clean)\n```\u2717 Cell 1 failed\n\nIt appears the environment is not responding to code execution. Possibly the kernel stopped after error. We may need to restart? But we cannot. Perhaps we should output final questions now? But we haven't explored data enough. However we cannot continue due to broken environment.\n\nGiven constraints, maybe we can generate questions based on typical columns we saw earlier: ID, Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Dt_Customer, Recency, MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds, NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5, AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, Complain, Z_CostContact, Z_Revenue, Response.\n\nWe can craft 30+ questions across difficulty levels. Since we cannot explore further, we assume typical analysis.\n\nProceed to output JSON with at least 30 questions.```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the average income of customers?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Use df['Income'].mean()\",\n      \"n_steps\": 1,\n      \"difficulty\": \"EASY\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the median recency (days since last purchase) for the dataset?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Use df['Recency'].median()\",\n      \"n_steps\": 1,\n      \"difficulty\": \"EASY\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"How many customers have at least one child at home (Kidhome > 0)?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Filter df where Kidhome > 0 and count rows.\",\n      \"n_steps\": 2,\n      \"difficulty\": \"EASY\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What proportion of customers are married?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Calculate the count of Marital_Status == 'Married' divided by total rows.\",\n      \"n_steps\": 2,\n      \"difficulty\": \"EASY\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Which product category (Wines, Fruits, MeatProducts, FishProducts, SweetProducts, GoldProds) has the highest total spend across all customers?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Sum each Mnt* column and compare.\",\n      \"n_steps\": 3,\n      \"difficulty\": \"EASY\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Is there a significant difference in average income between customers with and without teenage children at home?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Perform an independent t-test on Income grouped by Teenhome (0 vs 1).\",\n      \"n_steps\": 4,\n      \"difficulty\": \"MEDIUM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between Recency and total spend (sum of all Mnt* columns)?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Create a total spend column, then use scipy.stats.pearsonr.\",\n      \"n_steps\": 3,\n      \"difficulty\": \"MEDIUM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Do customers who responded positively (Response == 1) have a higher average number of web purchases than non\u2011respondents?\",\n      \"hint\": \"Group by Response and compare NumWebPurchases means;
